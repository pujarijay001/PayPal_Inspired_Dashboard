# 💳 Payments Dashboard (HTML + CSS)

This is a **static payments dashboard UI** inspired by apps like PayPal.  
I built this project using **HTML and CSS** as part of my learning journey.

I genuinely tried my best to build this project using whatever I’ve learned so far, focusing on **layout, structure, and clean CSS** rather than fancy effects or JavaScript.

## 📌 About the project

The dashboard includes:
- A top navigation bar
- Sidebar navigation
- A main dashboard area with cards showing:
  - Available balance
  - Recent transactions
  - Money in / money out
  - Quick actions
  - Account status

All data is static and the project is focused purely on layout and UI structure not on logic.

## 🧠 What I learned

- How to structure a real dashboard layout  
- Using **Flexbox** for the main page layout (navbar, sidebar, main content)  
- Using **CSS Grid** to arrange dashboard cards cleanly  
- Understanding parent vs child responsibility in layouts  
- Writing more semantic HTML (`nav`, `main`, lists)  
- Avoiding common CSS mistakes like overusing `position` and fixed heights  

---

## ⚠️ Challenges I faced

- Making the sidebar and main content work together correctly  
- Deciding when to control layout and when to let content flow naturally  
- Keeping spacing consistent across different sections  

This project helped me understand **why layouts break** and how to fix them properly.

## 🎯 What I want to improve next

- Make the layout fully responsive on smaller screens  
- Add hover and active states using CSS  
- Improve typography hierarchy and spacing  

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- HTML  
- CSS  
  - Flexbox (layout structure)  
  - Grid (dashboard cards)  

No JavaScript, no frameworks.

## 🙌 Final note

This is not a perfect project, but it represents my **honest effort and learning** at this stage.  
I’m sharing it to track progress and improve with each project.

Thanks for checking it out  🙂
